# Blinkit Sales Performance Dashboard

This project showcases a Power BI dashboard built to analyze retail sales performance, outlet distribution, and customer behavior. The dashboard brings together multiple KPIs into an interactive and visual format, allowing stakeholders to track business growth, evaluate product performance, and monitor outlet efficiency. The main purpose is to transform raw sales data into meaningful insights that support decision-making and highlight opportunities for optimization.

## Tech Stack

The project is developed entirely in Power BI, leveraging its capabilities such as:

* Data Modeling – Building relationships across different datasets for accurate reporting

* Power Query (M Language) – Cleaning, transforming, and shaping the raw data

* DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Creating custom measures and calculated columns for advanced metrics

* Interactive Visualizations – Designing charts, graphs, and slicers for easy exploration

* Dashboard Interactivity – Implementing filters, drill-throughs, and dynamic visuals for user-driven insights

## Data Source

The dataset used in this project was sourced from a YouTube channel that provides open datasets for practice and learning purposes. The data can also be accessed through the website link provided by the channel.
